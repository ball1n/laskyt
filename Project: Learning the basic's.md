## Project: Learning the basic's

I want to make a Salt module that will set up for a fresh computer two of my favourite desktop applications: Discord and Spotify. This project is last homework for Configure Management Systems Course from Tero Karvinen, [link to the course site](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/palvelinten-hallinta-2022p2/)

I'm doing the project with VirtualBox run Debian 64-bit.
My plan is to test the configured init.sls YAML, on my other virtual computer's and confirm that way, it works.

# Start of the project

First I needed to research how this is done and what kind of technical problems I might encounter. As I did not have the full picture of how this project would be done, in my head yet. I used as my help project's, done previously on Tero's same course, [link to the previous course's](https://terokarvinen.com/search/?q=palvelinten+hallinta). The most usefull for me was done by [Justus](https://github.com/Justus-stack/h7_moduli/blob/main/report.md).

# The beginning

I started the project first installing myself both Discord and Spotify to get all the right paths and informations, that I need for my init.sls file.

# How I installed Discord

I followed [this](https://www.how2shout.com/linux/3-ways-to-install-discord-on-debian-11-bullseye-linux/) quide on how to install Discord on Debian.

As told in the quide, Discord can't be found from the default system repository of Debian and need's to be downloaded manually as Deb binary from the [official wesbite](https://discord.com/download). For me the command did not work, so I downloaded it manually from the Discord website and then installed it.

After that, I had the app on my Debian.

# How I installed Spotify

For this I googled basically how to install Spotify for Debian and got simple instructions from Spotify's own [website](https://www.spotify.com/fi/download/linux/).

First I configured debian repository

    $ curl -sS https://download.spotify.com/debian/pubkey_5E3C45D7B312C643.gpg | sudo apt-key add - 
      echo "deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list
      
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install spotify-client

And there we go, now both Spotify and Discord have been installed to my Debian succesfully. Now I will start working the init.sls.

# Hard part of the project

I started making a new directory to /srv/salt and then creating init.sls file with "sudoedit". First I'm going to add Salt command for Spotify to the init.sls file

I had to use now help from [Justus project](https://github.com/Justus-stack/h7_moduli/blob/main/report.md) to get the YAML for my init.sls file. I though needed to edit the path for the key and list. List was found from **/etc/apt/sources.list.d** and key's were found at **/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d**.
Easy way for me to find the key was with the help of [Jesperi Kuula's homework](https://jesperikuula.wordpress.com/palvelinten-hallinta-viikko-4/)
I found from there a command,

    $ sudo apt-key list
    
And with this it was easy to find the right key for Spotify.

I will go add this to my init.sls. And this is the aftermath.

Also you need to copy them to the /srv/salt/project file, like this.

Now I can test, if it works.

And there we go. Spotify is added, now I move to take care of Discord.

First I will start with editing init.sls file and with the help of [Justus, again.](![Uploading image.pngâ€¦](https://github.com/Justus-stack/h7_moduli/blob/main/report.md)
I edit my path, where I downloaded by going to Firefox and copying from the link at downloads the right path.

This is how it looks like and after trying to run it on salt-call, it does not work. I'm getting this message.
